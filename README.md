To start with firmware developement you should visit [our documentation](https://tower.hardwario.com/en/latest/firmware/basic-overview/).
In the few sections you will install PlatformIO and build your first firmware with this platform.

To install this platform with PlatformIO CLI please use

``pio platform install hardwario-tower``

You can also install our library twr-sdk:

``pio lib --global install twr-sdk``

To work with our devices we recommend to use [twr-skeleton](https://github.com/hardwario/twr-skeleton).
You can find it in the examples. Or you can just clone this project and start working with the firmware.

After you are familiar with the skeleton, you can update it to your needs.

The platformio.ini file should look like this:
```
[platformio]
default_envs = debug

[env]
platform = hardwario-tower
board = core_module
framework = stm32cube
lib_deps = twr-sdk
monitor_speed = 115200
monitor_filters = default, send_on_enter
monitor_flags = --echo

[env:debug]
upload_protocol = serial

[env:release]
build_flags = -D RELEASE
upload_protocol = serial
```
